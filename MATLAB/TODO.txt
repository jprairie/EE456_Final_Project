TODO List

* make the "Did not find all bullets seperately" warning message more descriptive
    print which group and possibly other things

* when printing out pdf files, include the original image filename in the pdf filename

* develop a wrapper to call the different functions, like the testbeds but more formal

* add some more figures to show the resulting image during the various detection subroutines

* consider "montage" plot command for the segmented out original images?
